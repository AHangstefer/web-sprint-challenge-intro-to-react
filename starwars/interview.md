Interview Questions
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React JS solves the problem of using data that changes over time, and large amounts of data. React allows you to pass smaller amounts of data instead of large masses. 

Describe component state.

Component state is for managing data. The data only re-renders (using energy) when the data changes.

Describe props.

Props are like functions in Javascript. 
They allow you to pass data from one component to another. 

What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

A side effect is anything you've asked your function to do in addition to it's main goal. Pages in a react component are linked together, and if you need to use data from one page on another page, you create variables with the spesific data you'd like, pass a prop to the page you want to access data in, and then call the variables on that page.
